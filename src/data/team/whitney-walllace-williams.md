After graduation, Whitney returned to her hometown of Salisbury to practice law alongside her mother, Mona Lisa Wallace, and other talented colleagues at Wallace &amp; Graham, seeking to make a difference in the lives of others through the legal system.</p><p>From her very first memory, Whitney has had an innate passion to help people, particularly those bullied or underprivileged. Whitney’s passion for the law and justice was largely shaped by observing her mother advocate for clients in their deepest times of need during the entirety of her formative years. Her humor, groundedness, positive disposition, and efforts towards work/life balance are a credit to her exceptional father, Lee Wallace, a third generation real estate developer and owner of Wallace Realty.</p><p>Since 2008, Whitney has practiced civil litigation and workers’ compensation, helping hundreds of clients achieve justice and peace of mind through the legal system.

In 2020, she was invited by the North Carolina Industrial Commission to lecture at the Twenty-Sixth Annual North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Educational Conference.</p><p>Whitney is a member of the North Carolina State Bar, Rowan County Bar, Rowan County Bar Association (Past-President), American Association for Justice (AAJ), North Carolina Advocates for Justice (NCAJ), and the Public Justice Foundation (PJ). Outside of work, Whitney is deeply engaged with her community and nonprofit boards and is dedicated to making her small community of Salisbury and Rowan County the best that it can be. Since 2011, she has consistently served on boards, committees, and commissions, pursuing one passion project after another to improve the lives of local citizens.
