introTitle: The Need for Compensation for Camp Lejeune <span class="mil-accent">Illnesses</span>
---

Beginning in the 1950s and lasting all the way through the 1980s, military members and their families stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina may have been exposed to contaminated drinking water. Anyone who was there during that time frame, and has developed a medical condition potentially related to the contaminated water, may be eligible for compensation. Many types of cancer, as well as several other serious medical issues, have been potentially tied to the water at the camp.

Not only were service members affected, but their families, including unborn children, may have also been exposed to an ongoing situation of dangerous water quality. This concern over the quality of the water at the camp may have led to potentially serious medical conditions, as well as premature death from health problems. Once the water issues were discovered there were changes made, but by that time there were decades of exposure concerns for service members and their families.

##### What Was in the Camp Lejeune Water?

The water at Camp Lejeune potentially contained benzene, industrial solvents, and other, related types of chemicals. Compensation for Camp Lejeune illnesses is centered around these chemicals, and the length of time they were present in the water, as well as their concentration in that water. Many of the contaminants in the water came from dry cleaning operations that were on the base and nearby, but there were other contamination concerns, as well.

Among the biggest issues with the illnesses is that they were spread out over such a long period of time, impacting many military members and their families. Some illnesses showed up relatively quickly, while others took years or even decades to appear. The timeline and severity of the illnesses were affected by the types of chemicals in the water, along with personal and genetic factors. Finding all the victims of this water-quality issue has been an ongoing process that continues today.

##### What Kind of Camp Lejeune Illnesses Have Been Seen?

Several Camp Lejeune illnesses are on the list of commonly seen problems related to contamination in the water. These illnesses include multiple types of cancer, along with female infertility, miscarriage, and neurobehavioral problems. Cancers caused by the chemicals in the camp's water primarily affect the lungs, breast, bladder, and kidneys, along with the esophagus. These cancers can be deadly, and can strike both adults and children.

Additional types of cancer and other health problems related to Camp Lejeune and its water contamination issues include:

- Leukemia
- Multiple myeloma
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Myelodysplastic syndromes
- Hepatic steatosis
- Renal toxicity
- Scleroderma

Both service members and their families have been affected by these health problems, and there have been deaths in adults and children. Due to the seriousness and widespread nature of these illnesses, compensation for Camp Lejeune service members and their families is an important part of settling this issue. Families are still seeking compensation for children they lost and family members who have previously passed away.
