Two different industrial solvents were found in water samples. The Camp Lejeune water was supplied by the water treatment plants Tawara Terrace and Hadnot Point, both of which provided water for the barracks, enlisted family housing, recreational areas, base offices, and base schools.\r\n\r\nThe base hospital was also supplied with water from Hadnot Point, as was an industrial area. Because the area of contamination was so wide-spread, people all over the base were routinely exposed to water that contained dangerous chemicals. If you were on base during the Camp Lejeune water contamination dates, you may have health problems such as cancer that came from your exposure to dangerous chemicals during you or your loved one's military service. You may have also lost a loved one to cancer.\r\n\r\n###### What Caused the Water to be Contaminated?\r\n\r\nThe Camp Lejeune water contamination was caused by trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). The source of the PCE was mostly dry cleaning, while the TCE contamination had multiple sources. ABC One-Hour Cleaners, an off-base dry cleaning service, contaminated the groundwater in the area with PCE through improper disposal practices and spills. Dry cleaning operations began contaminating the area nearly as soon as the operations started.\r\n\r\nOn-base spills at various industrial sites, along with leaks from drums, storage lots, dump sites, and underground storage tanks all contributed to the TCE found in water quality and contaminant tests. Both treatment plants that supplied the Camp Lejeune water were eventually shut down, but it's not easy to be sure how long the contamination was taking place. The PCE contamination was believed to have begun almost immediately, with the TCE contamination not being tested for until the 1980s.\r\n\r\n###### How Long Was the Water Contaminated?\r\n\r\nThe Camp Lejeune water contamination dates range from 1953 to 1987. Anyone who spent as little as 30 days there during that time may have been impacted by the quality of the water and the chemicals in it. One of the most important things to note is that it's not just military members who were exposed. It was also their spouses, children, and even babies in utero. That resulted in cancers and other sicknesses, along with a lot of premature deaths in men, women, and even children and babies.\r\n\r\nMen who came to Camp Lejeune as 18-year-olds just starting out in their military career have died in their 40s and 50s from cancers that had no other known cause. Enlisted men and their wives lost babies to miscarriages, and lost young children to cancers and other health problems. The number of people getting sick within a few years of leaving the base, or becoming ill while they still lived and worked there, continues to grow and remains an ongoing health problem and legal issue.\r\n\r\n###### Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A\r\n\r\nIf you or a loved one spent at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between 1953 and 1987, and have health problems such as cancer or other serious illnesses, contact Wallace and Graham today. There are many ways that contaminated water can cause health problems, and the Camp Lejeune water contamination continued to put people at risk for decades. Serious cancers such as mesothelioma come from being exposed to unhealthy chemicals, and victims of this kind of exposure deserve compensation.\r\n\r\nReaching out for help is extremely important, and it allows you to get the support and guidance you need to pursue legal action. By working with us at Wallace and Graham, you can seek compensation for cancer or other illnesses that were caused by the Camp Lejeune water contamination, or that came about from working around asbestos as an auto mechanic or in other roles that compromised your health. Reach out to us today, and let's talk about the facts of your case.","title":"What Happened to the Camp Lejeune Water?","date":"2023-11-16","image":"/img/covers/hadnot_point.jpg","categories":["History"],"tags":["Design","UI"],"author":"wg","short":"The base hospital was also supplied with water from Hadnot Point, as was an industrial area.","introTitle":"What Happened to the <span class=\"mil-accent\">Camp Lejeune</span>  Water?"},{"id":"the-need-for-compensation-for-camp-lejeune-illnesses","content":"\r\nBeginning in the 1950s and lasting all the way through the 1980s, military members and their families stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina may have been exposed to contaminated drinking water. Anyone who was there during that time frame, and has developed a medical condition potentially related to the contaminated water, may be eligible for compensation. Many types of cancer, as well as several other serious medical issues, have been potentially tied to the water at the camp.\r\n\r\nNot only were service members affected, but their families, including unborn children, may have also been exposed to an ongoing situation of dangerous water quality. This concern over the quality of the water at the camp may have led to potentially serious medical conditions, as well as premature death from health problems. Once the water issues were discovered there were changes made, but by that time there were decades of exposure concerns for service members and their families.\r\n\r\n##### What Was in the Camp Lejeune Water?\r\n\r\nThe water at Camp Lejeune potentially contained benzene, industrial solvents, and other, related types of chemicals. Compensation for Camp Lejeune illnesses is centered around these chemicals, and the length of time they were present in the water, as well as their concentration in that water. Many of the contaminants in the water came from dry cleaning operations that were on the base and nearby, but there were other contamination concerns, as well.\r\n\r\nAmong the biggest issues with the illnesses is that they were spread out over such a long period of time, impacting many military members and their families. Some illnesses showed up relatively quickly, while others took years or even decades to appear. The timeline and severity of the illnesses were affected by the types of chemicals in the water, along with personal and genetic factors. Finding all the victims of this water-quality issue has been an ongoing process that continues today.\r\n\r\n##### What Kind of Camp Lejeune Illnesses Have Been Seen?\r\n\r\nSeveral Camp Lejeune illnesses are on the list of commonly seen problems related to contamination in the water. These illnesses include multiple types of cancer, along with female infertility, miscarriage, and neurobehavioral problems. Cancers caused by the chemicals in the camp's water primarily affect the lungs, breast, bladder, and kidneys, along with the esophagus. These cancers can be deadly, and can strike both adults and children.\r\n\r\nAdditional types of cancer and other health problems related to Camp Lejeune and its water contamination issues include:\r\n\r\n- Leukemia\r\n- Multiple myeloma\r\n- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n- Myelodysplastic syndromes\r\n- Hepatic steatosis\r\n- Renal toxicity\r\n- Scleroderma\r\n\r\nBoth service members and their families have been affected by these health problems, and there have been deaths in adults and children. Due to the seriousness and widespread nature of these illnesses, compensation for Camp Lejeune service members and their families is an important part of settling this issue. Families are still seeking compensation for children they lost and family members who have previously passed away.\r\n\r\n##### Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A. for Help Today\r\n\r\nIf you or a loved one may have been affected by the water quality at Camp Lejeune, reach out for legal help today. Contacting us at Wallace & Graham can give you the information and support you are looking for, to move forward with your claim. Whether you are battling one of these health conditions due to your time at the camp, or you have a loved one who is ill or who has passed away from a listed condition, working with the right legal representation can make a difference for your future.\r\n\r\nThe chemicals in the water at Camp Lejeune have affected countless people and forever changed their lives and the lives of their family members. Due to the ongoing nature of the issue, many of these cases are just now coming to light. Working with us at Wallace & Graham can give you the legal support you need, to fight for compensation for Camp Lejeune illnesses.","title":"The Need for Compensation for Camp Lejeune Illnesses","date":"2023-11-16","image":"/img/covers/va.jpg","categories":["Architecture"],"tags":["Branding","Construction","Development","UI"],"author":"wg","short":"families, including unborn children, may have also been exposed to an ongoing situation of dangerous water quality.","introTitle":"The Need for Compensation for Camp Lejeune <span class=\"mil-accent\">Illnesses</span>"},{"id":"camp-lejeune-water-contamination-and-what-it-means-to-you","content":"\r\nIn the early 1980s, the Marine Corps Base Camp in North Carolina, Lejeune, discovered that two of its water supply systems were contaminated with two industrial solvents. Scientists found both trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), both of which can cause serious health problems for those exposed. Supplied by the Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point treatment plants, it meant that both marines and their families would have come in direct contact with this poisoned water. Despite all of the laws, though, not every family or individual was able to get the help they needed to fight these illnesses. We look at how these two chemicals affect the body, who’s broken their silence about the matter from the base, what’s occurred since this 40-year-old discovery came to light, and what it all ultimately means for you.\r\n\r\n##### Health Effects\r\n\r\nTCE and PTE are often used for cleaning metal parts of machinery. They’re both known as Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC), meaning they emit a gas into the air that can be harmful on its own. It can also mix with other pollutants in the air to cause a number of ill health effects. TCE is best known for its link to cancer, particularly kidney cancer. There is also some research to suggest that it’s linked with liver cancer and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. PCE can cause breathing problems, vision problems, headaches, and even issues with muscle coordination. When either PCE or TCE breaks down, it can form vinyl chloride (VC). VC can cause anything from fatigue to coma and death. The presence of any of these chemicals in the air can irritate the eyes and respiratory tract.\r\n\r\n##### Camp Lejeune Testimonials\r\n\r\nWhen people talk about living on the base and detail their Camp Lejeune claims, they remember how nice the housing was and how many new people there were to meet. However, it’s clear that life there took a toll on their long-term health. Antoinette Scott was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011, a disease she managed to live through, but not without a lot of pain, stress, and aftermath of the disease.\r\n\r\nAfter spending many years living at Camp Lejeune with her ex-husband drinking the water, playing in the pool, showering, etc, she was experiencing more than three decades worth of contamination. She ultimately blames the base for failing to keep its people safe. While her bills were covered by military insurance, many people’s claims were denied. Congress has had to step in to vote for more benefits. North Carolina also has a strict statute of limitations for any suit brought against the government, which has ultimately limited families from having any recourse at all.\r\n\r\n##### Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.\r\n\r\nWhile North Carolina’s law made it difficult for people to file suit before, there have been recent developments to bring more justice to the table. Representative Davide Price said that Camp Lejeune was unfair in every sense of the word. It’s why he and fellow Representative Greg Murphy are co-sponsors of the Campe Lejuene Justice Act.\r\n\r\nThis law essentially gives people their day in court, and it’s already passed the US House. Nearly a million people may have come into contact with contaminated water, which could mean thousands of lawsuits. As the sponsors put it, this has nothing to do with what side of the aisle you’re on. Those who were damaged by this water deserve to have justice on their side. There is no taking back the tragedy in North Carolina, but there are ways to go about getting some relief from it. Mona Lisa Wallace and her partner Bill Graham have a staff that is passionate about working with clients until they get what they need.

The Marine Corps Base Camp in North Carolina discovered that two major supply systems were contaminated with industrial solvents, essentially poisoning the water for everyone on base. The effects were catastrophic for marines and their families. U.S. Marine Sgt. Jerry Ensminger claims that his daughter, Janey, passed away due to the contamination.\r\n\r\nAfter developing leukemia, a potential side effect of consuming trichloroethylene (TCE), she would fight through treatments only to lose the battle at the age of just 9 years old. He said that even though the Marines knew about the problem, they did nothing — even as his young child lay dying. We look at the generational toll that Camp Lejeune took and what kind of recourse residents have if they want to take action or pursue justice.\r\n\r\n##### Camp Lejeune Water Contamination\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980s, it was clear that Marines knew that there was both trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) in the water. This water was supplied by two treatment plants: Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point. Children who lived on the base may not have known the scientific makeup of the chemicals, but they certainly noticed when contractors discovered the bodies of radioactive dogs in the soil of a parking lot in the 1980s. It was just one example of many that proved hazardous waste was being disposed of on base.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, the chemicals in the water were up to 3,400 times what is considered safe by standards of the day. There were so many people passing through the camp, some staying there for only a few weeks, that it’s difficult to know what exactly happened to those who was exposed to the water. Not only will TCE and PCE increase the likelihood of anything from renal cancer to multiple myeloma, it increases the odds of adverse birth effects as well.\r\n\r\n##### A Tragic Toll of Camp Lejeune\r\n\r\nIt’s clear that some people will never even know what happened to them if they were on base during this time period. The data that we have, which is often pieced together by public health agencies with limited resources, is slow to come out. Lori Lou Freshwater, who grew up on the base in the 1980s, would recount her experiences in an article for Pacific Standard as a way of quantifying what happened.\r\n\r\nShe talks about how her brother passed away after living for just a month. She talked about her mother dying of leukemia years later. Freshwater’s mother spoke out against the contamination in a public meeting before her death, decrying the reduction of her experience into numbers and statistics. She correctly points out that the poisoning was a tragedy, one that would live on for many years to come. Freshwater now has two boxes that carry the ashes of her family, both of which stand side-by-side in her home.\r\n\r\n##### Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.\r\n\r\nThere's some action taking place in Congress right now to ensure that victims get their due. A Camp Lejeune settlement can't take away what occurred, but it can ensure that people get the financial support they need to cover any number of healthcare or funeral related expenses. Mona Lisa Wallace and her partner Bill Graham don’t want anyone to suffer more than they have already, which is why they're available to fight for their client's rights. While the Camp Lejeune Justice Act, spurred on by Representative Davide Price and fellow Representative Greg Murphy, has not yet passed, it looks like it's only a matter of time. If you want to learn more about how the attorneys and staff at Wallace and Graham, P.A. can help, contact us today for more information.\r\n","title":"Camp Lejeune: A Look Back At The Contamination That Has Affected Many Generations","date":"2023-11-16","image":"/img/covers/lejeuneAir.jpg","categories":["Design"],"tags":["Design","Development"],"author":"wg","short":"Camp Lejeune has been the subject of controversy for quite some time now.","introTitle":"<span class=\"mil-accent\">Camp Lejeune&col; </span>A Look Back At The Contamination That Has Affected Many Generations"},{"id":"illnesses-from-camp-lejeune","content":"\r\nFor military members and their families who were stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1950 through the mid-1980s, potential health problems from water contamination are a serious concern. Cancers and other health issues plagued these members and families, many of whom have died or experienced ongoing, significant medical issues. The contamination was not discovered for a number of years, and by the time it was found there were already illnesses being reported in the military community.\r\n\r\nThe water was found to have benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), vinyl chloride, and other contaminants in it. Many of these chemicals come from dry cleaning, and they were found in nearly all the water at the camp's primary areas. That includes the water that was used in on-base housing, exposing spouses, children, and other family members to those dangerous chemicals on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n###### What Camp Lejeune Illnesses Are Common?\r\n\r\nWhile there are many illnesses that can potentially be tied back to the water at the camp, the most common Camp Lejeune illnesses are related to cancer. These include cancer of the esophagus, kidneys, breast, lungs, and bladder. Additionally, there are other types of cancer and other kinds of health problems related to the contaminated water. These problems have been seen in the past, and are still being found today in individuals who were exposed to the chemicals. Among the most frequently noted illnesses are:\r\n\r\n- Multiple myeloma\r\n- Leukemia\r\n- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n- Myelodysplastic syndromes\r\n- Female infertility and miscarriage\r\n- Hepatic steatosis\r\n- Renal toxicity\r\n- Neurobehavioral effects\r\n- Scleroderma\r\n\r\nWith this significant number of illnesses, and the impact they can have on military members and their families, there have been numerous investigations into the water at the camp and the levels of contamination that water contained. The impact of the illnesses on future generations has also been noted, as a number of the family members who were impacted by the water quality were children, some of whom have died from cancer and other health conditions potentially related to chemical exposure.\r\n\r\n###### The Impact of Illnesses on Future Generations\r\n\r\nThe VA has ruled that some above-mentioned illnesses are found to have a service-related connection, while there is insufficient evidence to make that ruling about other conditions. However, the impact of illnesses on future generations remains. Many families lost children and other loved ones to the health issues the water contamination at Camp Lejeune created. Still other children grew into adults with serious medical conditions and health issues that need monitoring and ongoing treatment.\r\n\r\nFemale infertility was one of the potential conditions caused by the contamination in the camp's water. While the VA failed to add it to their list of service-related illnesses, it has had an impact on the service members and spouses who wanted to add to their families. It has also impacted the female children born to these families, who may also struggle with infertility issues due to their exposure to contaminated water in their formative years. Generations of health problems and difficulties have come from this issue.\r\n\r\n###### Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A. for the Support You Need\r\n\r\nReach out to us today at Wallace & Graham, to get the information and support you need to fight for compensation related to Camp Lejeune illnesses. Whether you are a military member who was stationed there, or part of a family who also spent time on the base, you deserve fair and just compensation for medical issues you're experiencing. There are many issues that can come from exposure to contaminated water, and the longer the exposure the more risk you may have.\r\n\r\nChemicals in drinking water can cause cancers and other contamination issues, and receiving compensation for the harm done to your health is important. Many military members and their families have lost loved ones to cancer or other health conditions that can potentially be tied back to Camp Lejeune's water quality. If you were stationed there, or had a family member who was, reaching out for legal help is the right choice.","title":"Illnesses from Camp Lejeune","date":"2022-04-02","image":"/img/covers/campLejeune.jpg","categories":["Urban"],"tags":["Branding","UI","Design"],"author":"wg","short":"Cancers and other health issues plagued these members and families","introTitle":"<span class=\"mil-accent\">Illnesses </span>from Camp Lejeune"},{"id":"filing-a-claim-effect-my-va-benefits","content":"\r\n This is by far the most common and concerning question that is called into our office by our veteran clients.  We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight for all veterans and veteran service organizations (VSOs). \r\n\r\n The answer is NO.  \r\n\r\n The Navy's Tort Claims Unit (TCU) has said on its official website relating to the CLJA claims that \"[c]laims filed with the TCU do not impact benefits or programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\" \r\n\r\nSource: https://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/code_15_Camp_Lejeune_Claims.htm.\r\n\r\n Similarly, the VA through a spokesperson has recently said in a Verify article that veterans' CLJA claims will not have their VA benefits reduced because of any additional compensation from the CLJA.  The spokesperson also said \"if a veteran is already receiving VA benefits as a result of disability related to contaminated water exposure at Camp Lejeune, their court award will be reduced by the value of those benefits.\" \r\n\r\nSource: https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/camp-lejeune-justice-act-2022-honoring-our-pact-act-water-how-to-file-claim-fact-check/536-b1e0baef-193f-429e-8e0a-8faf7ad78cbd)\r\n\r\n Notably, the spokesperson for the VA correctly stated that the veterans’ “court award” may be reduced -- not the veterans’ VA benefits.  This means that only once an individual receives a court award can the government seek any potential reduction (offset) to the award for VA benefits that individual has received.  The government could also presumably waive the offset entirely in negotiations. \r\n\r\n We believe the Navy’s and the VA’s positions are consistent and in line with the CLJA statute.  We are aware of no examples of any governmental agency taking contrary positions.  So far, we are only aware of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) nonprofit organization taking a seemingly different position in a recent VFW Magazine article, referenced below.\r\n\r\n The offset provision in the CLJA clearly states:\r\n\r\n(2) HEALTH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS RELATING TO WATER EXPOSURE.—\r\n\r\nAny award made to an individual, or legal representative of an individual, under this section shall be offset by the amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit provided to the individual, or legal representative—\r\n\r\n(A) under—\r\n\r\n(i) any program under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\r\n\r\n(ii) the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); or\r\n\r\n(iii) the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and\r\n\r\n(B) in connection with health care or a disability relating to exposure to the water at Camp Lejeune.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added)  \r\n\r\n See Sect. 804(d)(2) https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/text \r\n\r\n We believe there are two key parts of this legislation directly relevant to this issue.  \r\n\r\n Only An Award Can Be Offset.  First, the law clearly states that only a CLJA “award” (i.e., settlement, verdict, etc.) can be offset, i.e. reduced, by whatever “amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit ... provided to the individual ... under any [VA-administered program, Medicare, or Medicaid].”  Black’s Law Dictionary defines “offset” simply as “a reduction.”  Therefore, according to the plain language of the statute, only a CLJA award shall be reduced by the amount of VA/Medicare/Medicaid benefits that the government can prove are related to the harm caused by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  The purpose of an offset is to prevent a double-recovery, where the government would have to pay a veteran twice for the same damages.  \r\n\r\n Only a CLJA-Related Benefit Is Subject to an Award Offset.  The second provision of importance (sect. 804(d)(2)(B) highlighted above) clarifies that the veteran’s CLJA award could only be reduced to the extent the veterans’ VA provided benefit was related to the same water-related illness. For example, the government will have to prove that the VA benefit (e.g., health care or monthly disability benefits) was related to the veterans’ contaminated water disease/harm.  \r\n\r\n Example: If a veteran is on 100% disability for combat-related PTSD and a knee injury, but his/her CLJA award is for kidney cancer, the government would not be permitted to take any offset for monthly disability benefits from that veteran’s CLJA settlement because the government cannot prove the disability benefits are related to the harm caused by toxic water.  There would be no “double recovery” for the veteran under those circumstances.  \r\n\r\n In an opposite example, if a veteran is getting 100% disability for kidney cancer, and his/her CLJA award is also related to kidney cancer, then the statute states that the veteran’s CLJA court award may be reduced by the amount of benefits they have received from the VA for kidney cancer-related health care or disability. \r\n\r\n However, it is important to note that the reduction is only permitted up to the date of the claim's resolution because a reduction is only permitted on the award, not on VA benefits.  Even under this scenario, where the VA benefits were provided for the proven CLJA-related harm, there is no indication that the benefits can or would be reduced on an ongoing basis.  Only the court award or settlement – not future VA benefits - would be reduced by the previous VA benefits provided.\r\n\r\n Key takeaways from this provision include: \r\n\r\nIf you do not prevail in the case, your benefits will never be affected\r\nIf you win your lawsuit and get a verdict or settlement from the U.S. Government, only then will the government be allowed a reduction of the award for already-provided VA benefits. \r\nBut in order to receive the reduction, the U.S. Government will have the burden of proving that the provided VA benefit was related to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.\r\nThere is little likelihood, if any, that a veteran would receive no settlement after the government reductions, as that would be inequitable and a settlement that no veteran or civilian would likely accept after being exposed unknowingly to contaminated water and suffering a terrible harm, disease, or cancer.  \r\nThere is a reasonably likely possibility that the government – as a part of a settlement – could waive the government’s entitlement to an offset or reduction, due to the complexity of analyzing each individual case for a reduction and their burden to prove that the benefit was related to the disease/harm caused by contaminated water.\r\n \r\n\r\n It is important to note that the Camp Lejeune Justice Act statute is very different from how a contaminated water claim was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151, if a veteran is awarded any compensation from a FTCA claim related to the same injury/illness for which the veteran also receives VA benefits, the VA can suspend benefits until the full amount of the FTCA award is recovered.  The language that is present in the Federal Tort Claims Act statute is not present in the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.  Source: 38 U.S.C. § 1151 (b)(1); https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1151.  The Camp Lejeune Justice Act allows an offset on the award and not a suspension of benefits.  \r\n\r\n In its recent Fall 2022 edition, VFW Magazine published an article and included quotations by VFW General Counsel John Muckelbauer causing veterans to believe that filing a claim under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act could potentially cause their VA benefits to stop or be suspended.  VFW is a nonprofit veterans’ service organization (VSO).  This nonprofit program has many members and has been wonderfully helpful and trusted to veterans for decades.  However, it is not a governmental entity and is not involved with the administration of VA benefits nor is it the entity who is handling and/or litigating these claims on behalf of the United States (Department of Navy/Torts Claims Unit and Department of Justice (DOJ)).  We have had conversations with Mr. Muckelbauer, who was kind enough to speak to us after the article was released, and we are continuing to work with the VFW and Mr. Muckelbauer to ensure that truthful and accurate information is circulated to veterans.  \r\n\r\n Our firm encourages veterans to rely upon the plain language of the statute as well as the guidance which has been issued directly by the VA and Navy’s Tort Claims Unit which unequivocally states that claims filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act do not impact benefits or programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Any offset, or reduction, would only be to a court award to prevent “double recovery,” and only for VA benefits which are proven to be related to the harm caused by the contaminated water and have been received prior to the date of the award. \r\n\r\n If you continue to have any questions about whether filing a claim under the CLJA will affect your past or future benefits, please do not hesitate to contact our firm by emailing justiceforcamplejeune@wallacegraham.com or calling or texting Wallace & Graham, PA in Salisbury, NC at 704-633-5244.","title":"Will Filing A Claim Under The Camp Lejeune Justice Act (CLJA) Affect My VA Benefits?","date":"2022-03-02","image":"/img/covers/va.jpg","categories":["va"],"tags":["VA","Design"],"author":"wg","short":"This is by far the most common and concerning question that is called into our office by our veteran clients.
