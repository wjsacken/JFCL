She has successfully litigated thousands of claims involving asbestos and other toxic exposures.&nbsp; She has taken on some of the largest corporations in the world in her relentless quest for justice.</p><p>Mona Lisa was born and raised in the small communities of Salisbury and Spencer, North Carolina.&nbsp;Growing up, she was determined to better herself and find a way to help those around her, showing early leadership skills.&nbsp; In high school, she was elected as the first female Student Body President at North Rowan High School while also excelling in sports and academics.&nbsp; A National Merit Scholar, she attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1976 after three years. She attended Wake Forest University School of Law, where she received a Juris Doctor Degree in 1979.&nbsp;With a law degree in hand, she returned to Salisbury to practice law but had difficulty getting a job as female trial lawyers were a novelty at that time.&nbsp; Her first job&nbsp;involved&nbsp;a focus on family law, representing victims of domestic abuse,&nbsp;which required being in court daily and learning how to argue&nbsp;against&nbsp;the most difficult and adversarial of opponents.</p><p>In early 1981, a local gentleman who could not breathe sought her help, and before long, she became one of the first and most successful asbestos trial lawyers in the Southeast.&nbsp;In this era of the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;asbestos litigation, cases were difficult.&nbsp; Before liability had been established, Mona Lisa often found herself the sole attorney for the victim, and the only female attorney, facing a courtroom full of corporate defense attorneys.&nbsp;She faced heavy odds, but by the 1990s, Mona Lisa had successfully represented thousands of employees who had become ill due to asbestos exposure in a wide variety of industrial settings. She had some of the largest asbestos settlements for workers reported and numerous important cases, including the&nbsp;<em>Satterfield</em>&nbsp;decision&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Tennessee Supreme Court.&nbsp; In&nbsp;<em>Satterfield</em>, a father had worked in an Alcoa plant for many years and unbeknownst to him, his clothing carried deadly asbestos dust home to his family, which was inhaled by his infant daughter after her birth.&nbsp; In&nbsp;deciding the case, the Court&nbsp;recognized a right to sue for reasonably&nbsp;foreseeable&nbsp;users&nbsp;of asbestos, including household&nbsp;members who were&nbsp;exposed.&nbsp; Through years of litigation,&nbsp;by the strength of this case and others,&nbsp;Mona Lisa&nbsp;has worked to successfully&nbsp;force employers to provide a safer&nbsp;workplace and to medically&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;their&nbsp;employees&nbsp;for foreseeable diseases,&nbsp;thereby&nbsp;saving countless lives.</p><p>Mona Lisa has taken a personal interest in the claims of victims of occupational cancers. Even after OSHA regulations were put in place to&nbsp;reduce workplace&nbsp;hazards, Mona Lisa still saw a steady stream of people exposed to dangerous chemicals and products in the workplace who later developed cancer. While asbestos cancers have been widely publicized, the public remains less aware of the many other&nbsp;kinds of&nbsp;toxic substances and chemicals that&nbsp;can&nbsp;cause cancer. Mona Lisa has sought to heighten public awareness on this issue and to promote early medical screening and assessment.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Mona Lisa grew the law firm into other practice areas.&nbsp;She brought successful class actions for employees and retirees who claimed their medical and retirement benefits were&nbsp;being&nbsp;unfairly reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace and Graham was able to&nbsp;recover millions of dollars for these workers and retirees in class actions addressing their pension and medical benefits with one settlement alone in excess of $178 million.&nbsp; She also took on predatory lenders, the results of which brought significant refunds to tens of thousands of low-income borrowers&nbsp;afflicted with “payday loans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cases started, the state was full of brick-and-mortar payday lending stores that trapped working people inside a cycle of debt. But after the cases were brought, the stores left the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mona Lisa also brought several class action lawsuits against car dealers for alleged unfair and deceptive sales practices, obtaining significant settlements. She co-counseled with the U.S. Department of Justice on claims of alleged improper medical billing and warranty practices under the Federal False Claims Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tennessee, she&nbsp;filed a suit against a medical device company based on “whistleblower” testimony that the company had failed to honor warranties on its products, which caused the Medicare system to overpay. As a result of her efforts,&nbsp;in which she worked with attorneys with the Department of Justice,&nbsp;the device maker paid a multi-million-dollar settlement.</p><p>In the last 15 years, the firm&nbsp;also&nbsp;began to take on corporations who abuse the natural environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mona Lisa and her team have successfully sued many corporate wrongdoers involving such environmental toxins as coal ash, asbestos, chemicals, and most recently, hog waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2013 to&nbsp;2020, Mona Lisa and her litigation team&nbsp;represented eastern N.C. families in&nbsp;one of the largest environmental claims in state history with&nbsp;“private nuisance”&nbsp;lawsuits brought&nbsp;against&nbsp;the hog production component of behemoth multinational&nbsp;Smithfield Foods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mona Lisa represented 500 neighbors against Chinese-owned Smithfield, alleging the antiquated “lagoon and spray” method of hog waste disposal was interfering with clients’ use and enjoyment of their&nbsp;homes&nbsp;and lands.&nbsp; In back-to-back&nbsp;trials&nbsp;extending through&nbsp;2018 and 2019,&nbsp;five different&nbsp;juries unanimously sided with the plaintiffs, awarding damages exceeding $500 million.&nbsp; The surprise twists and turns of the litigation, and the seemingly insurmountable odds, will be featured by author Corban Addison in his book,&nbsp;<u>Wastelands</u>, to be released to the public on June 7, 2022.</p><p>Mona Lisa&apos;s most recent legal efforts focus on two critical issues we currently face in our&nbsp;State&nbsp;as ordinary individuals: 1) excessive and unfair medical billing practices&nbsp;practiced&nbsp;by large hospital chains operating a monopoly in certain regions of the&nbsp;State,&nbsp;and 2) improving the safety and quality of care in North Carolina’s nursing homes, particularly those owned by private equity firms and&nbsp;for-profit&nbsp;chain corporations.</p><p>Regarding nursing home&nbsp;abuse, the firm has brought a putative class action claim regarding the alleged systematic understaffing of nursing homes, and represents one or more families in individual nursing home cases for abuse, injury or wrongful death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2022, in the State of the Union Address, President Biden and the White House highlighted nursing home negligence as an issue of national concern, identifying issues consistent with those identified by our clients.

Attorney General Josh Stein (Democrat) has also filed an amicus brief in support of the litigation.</p><p>The awards and recognition that Mona Lisa Wallace has achieved for her legal work are voluminous.&nbsp; She has been named the Public Justice American Trial Lawyer of the Year on two different occasions and was a runner-up on another (2019, 2020).&nbsp; She is the first woman to receive the Tommy Malone Eagle Award bestowed by the Southern Trial Lawyers (2020).&nbsp; She has consistently been acknowledged as one of the top 100 trial lawyers and among the Leaders in the Law for N.C.&nbsp; She received the Achieve Award from Public Justice for her work in Consumer Litigation.&nbsp;She won North Carolina Advocates for Justice’s Ebbie Award and the North Carolina Gertrude S.
