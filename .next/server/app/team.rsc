Rhine","role":"Rhine Law Firm","category_slug":"rhine","order":5,"fullImage":"/img/faces/joel-rhine.jpg","description":" <p>Joel R. Rhine is a nationally recognized trial attorney who chooses to live in Wilmington, North Carolina. Mr. Rhine enjoys the best of both worlds: he leads the Rhine Law Firm, P.C.’s charge on a host of important North Carolina cases, while participating in large national cases (primarily class action and mass tort cases with an occasional massive single-event matter). Mr. Rhine has decades of experience in complex litigation and is one of the most recognized and respected trial attorneys in North Carolina.</p> <p>Mr. Rhine is comfortable in the complex trial atmosphere, where his fee and the reimbursement of the firm’s advanced expenses are fully dependent on a successful resolution. In many instances, his clients have no viable economic future if the case is lost. Often, the defense considers the case to be “bet the company” litigation and hires the top lawyers from the largest law firms to defend the case. These lawsuits are tough and expensive – often, the advanced costs are in the six- and seven-figure range. Of course, when the stakes are this high, the lawyers are sharp, skilled, and prepared. This is the setting for Mr. Rhine’s contingency-fee caseload.</p> <p>Mr. Rhine is constantly seeking challenges and thus the types of cases he works on are varied. This variety is exemplified by a sampling of his recent results and pending cases:</p> <ul> <li>Several seven-figure recoveries in a series of stairway and deck collapses in vacation rental homes in coastal North Carolina;</li> <li>$25 million plus settlement in a Pella Window Class Action in the North District of Illinois&nbsp;<i>(Eubank, et al v. Pella Corporation and Pella Windows and Doors (United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 06 C 44810));</i></li> <li>Co-lead counsel in the largest individual Chinese Drywall settlement, which was valued at over $24 million;</li> <li>Co-lead counsel in&nbsp;<i>Finerman et al v. Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc, and International Cruise &amp; Excursion Gallery</i>&nbsp;(United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, 3:14-cv-1154) which settled for over $16.5 million (including attorneys’ fees);</li> <li>Lead counsel for three victims injured in the Florida International University Bridge Collapse in Miami (this matter is still pending);</li> <li>$3.1 million settlement that occurred during trial in a bus collision case occurring in Virginia;</li> <li>$9.0 million wrongful death judgment from a parasailing tragedy in North Carolina;</li> <li>$2.0 million recovery related to a motorcycle vs. truck accident in North Carolina;</li> <li>Significant confidential settlements for victims of the Oak Island Bridge Collapse over the ICWW in North Carolina;</li> <li>Member of the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in the Benicar (Olmesartan) Products Liability Litigation in New Jersey.</li> </ul> <p>Mr. Rhine’s hard work has been recognized by his peers and many publications. Mr. Rhine has been recognized repeatedly as a Super Lawyer – Top 100 North Carolina Lawyers; Business North Carolina’s Legal Elite; Best Lawyers; National Trial Lawyers Top 100 Trial Lawyers; and has enjoyed an AV rating from Martindale Hubbell since 2002. The Rhine Law Firm, P.C., has repeatedly been named a “Tier 1 Best Firm” by U.S. News and World Reports.</p> <h3>Background</h3> <ul> <li>Mr. Rhine graduated from Wake Forest University Law School in 1988 as one of the only students ever to be published twice in the Law Review.</li> <li>After WFU, Mr. Rhine accepted a “big law” position with Hunton &amp; Williams in their Raleigh office. His work at Hunton &amp; Willams was dominated by two nuclear power plant construction cases, one in Dallas/Fort Worth and the other in Raleigh.</li> <li>In the early 1990s, Mr. Rhine moved to Wilmington and established a contingency fee construction, product liability, and personal injury practice.</li> <li>Mr. Rhine achieved his first eight-figure verdict in a federal jury trial at age 30.</li> <li>Mr. Rhine filed the first lawsuit in what became the multi-decade, multi-state synthetic stucco (EIFS) litigation, where he represented thousands of homeowners against a variety of constructions participants and manufacturers. When this mass tort litigation bogged down, Mr. Rhine began taking the cases to trial. The first trial ended in a settlement after six weeks of testimony. Later, Mr. Rhine obtained the nation’s first verdict against an EIFS manufacturer. This multimillion-dollar verdict was a catalyst for a national EIFS settlement against this EIFS manufacturer.</li> <li>Mr. Rhine sought new challenges after the EIFS litigation, including class actions of many types, business dispute litigation, catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases, product liability actions, and data breach cases. He is regularly invited to participate in interesting, important, and complex litigation by attorneys who know his trial talents, integrity, and work ethic. He has been counsel, lead counsel, or a member of the plaintiff steering committee in dozens of class actions and national mass tort cases.</li> </ul> <p>As a frequently requested speaker on legal topics for trial lawyers and judges, Mr. Rhine speaks at continuing education seminars on topics ranging from trial skills, class actions, ethics, and more. Mr. Rhine has presented on multiple occasions throughout the United States for, among others, Mass Torts Made Perfect, North Carolina Advocates of Justice, North Carolina Bar Association, Mealeys, Lorman, and the AEI-Brookings Joint Center Judicial Education Program.</p> <p>Finally, and above all, Mr. Rhine is a devoted family man. He and Alice Rhine will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in May 2020. Their son, Michael, graduated from the Kenan-Flagler Business School at UNC-Chapel Hill and is an investment banker in Charlotte. Their daughter, Julia, is a student at UNC-Chapel Hill.</p> ","info":["Location: Wilmington, NC, USA","Phone: 866-772-9960"]},{"id":"larry-hall","image":"/img/faces/LarryHall.jpg","name":"Larry Hall","role":"Wallace & Graham","category_slug":"wg","order":0,"fullImage":"/img/faces/LarryHall.jpg","description":" <p>Following a long and dedicated career in public service, Larry D.

She has successfully litigated thousands of claims involving asbestos and other toxic exposures.&nbsp; She has taken on some of the largest corporations in the world in her relentless quest for justice.</p><p>Mona Lisa was born and raised in the small communities of Salisbury and Spencer, North Carolina.&nbsp;Growing up, she was determined to better herself and find a way to help those around her, showing early leadership skills.&nbsp; In high school, she was elected as the first female Student Body President at North Rowan High School while also excelling in sports and academics.&nbsp; A National Merit Scholar, she attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1976 after three years. She attended Wake Forest University School of Law, where she received a Juris Doctor Degree in 1979.&nbsp;With a law degree in hand, she returned to Salisbury to practice law but had difficulty getting a job as female trial lawyers were a novelty at that time.&nbsp; Her first job&nbsp;involved&nbsp;a focus on family law, representing victims of domestic abuse,&nbsp;which required being in court daily and learning how to argue&nbsp;against&nbsp;the most difficult and adversarial of opponents.</p><p>In early 1981, a local gentleman who could not breathe sought her help, and before long, she became one of the first and most successful asbestos trial lawyers in the Southeast.&nbsp;In this era of the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;asbestos litigation, cases were difficult.&nbsp; Before liability had been established, Mona Lisa often found herself the sole attorney for the victim, and the only female attorney, facing a courtroom full of corporate defense attorneys.&nbsp;She faced heavy odds, but by the 1990s, Mona Lisa had successfully represented thousands of employees who had become ill due to asbestos exposure in a wide variety of industrial settings. She had some of the largest asbestos settlements for workers reported and numerous important cases, including the&nbsp;<em>Satterfield</em>&nbsp;decision&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Tennessee Supreme Court.&nbsp; In&nbsp;<em>Satterfield</em>, a father had worked in an Alcoa plant for many years and unbeknownst to him, his clothing carried deadly asbestos dust home to his family, which was inhaled by his infant daughter after her birth.&nbsp; In&nbsp;deciding the case, the Court&nbsp;recognized a right to sue for reasonably&nbsp;foreseeable&nbsp;users&nbsp;of asbestos, including household&nbsp;members who were&nbsp;exposed.&nbsp; Through years of litigation,&nbsp;by the strength of this case and others,&nbsp;Mona Lisa&nbsp;has worked to successfully&nbsp;force employers to provide a safer&nbsp;workplace and to medically&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;their&nbsp;employees&nbsp;for foreseeable diseases,&nbsp;thereby&nbsp;saving countless lives.</p><p>Mona Lisa has taken a personal interest in the claims of victims of occupational cancers. Even after OSHA regulations were put in place to&nbsp;reduce workplace&nbsp;hazards, Mona Lisa still saw a steady stream of people exposed to dangerous chemicals and products in the workplace who later developed cancer. While asbestos cancers have been widely publicized, the public remains less aware of the many other&nbsp;kinds of&nbsp;toxic substances and chemicals that&nbsp;can&nbsp;cause cancer. Mona Lisa has sought to heighten public awareness on this issue and to promote early medical screening and assessment.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Mona Lisa grew the law firm into other practice areas.&nbsp;She brought successful class actions for employees and retirees who claimed their medical and retirement benefits were&nbsp;being&nbsp;unfairly reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace and Graham was able to&nbsp;recover millions of dollars for these workers and retirees in class actions addressing their pension and medical benefits with one settlement alone in excess of $178 million.&nbsp; She also took on predatory lenders, the results of which brought significant refunds to tens of thousands of low-income borrowers&nbsp;afflicted with “payday loans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cases started, the state was full of brick-and-mortar payday lending stores that trapped working people inside a cycle of debt. But after the cases were brought, the stores left the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mona Lisa also brought several class action lawsuits against car dealers for alleged unfair and deceptive sales practices, obtaining significant settlements. She co-counseled with the U.S. Department of Justice on claims of alleged improper medical billing and warranty practices under the Federal False Claims Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tennessee, she&nbsp;filed a suit against a medical device company based on “whistleblower” testimony that the company had failed to honor warranties on its products, which caused the Medicare system to overpay. As a result of her efforts,&nbsp;in which she worked with attorneys with the Department of Justice,&nbsp;the device maker paid a multi-million-dollar settlement.</p><p>In the last 15 years, the firm&nbsp;also&nbsp;began to take on corporations who abuse the natural environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mona Lisa and her team have successfully sued many corporate wrongdoers involving such environmental toxins as coal ash, asbestos, chemicals, and most recently, hog waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2013 to&nbsp;2020, Mona Lisa and her litigation team&nbsp;represented eastern N.C. families in&nbsp;one of the largest environmental claims in state history with&nbsp;“private nuisance”&nbsp;lawsuits brought&nbsp;against&nbsp;the hog production component of behemoth multinational&nbsp;Smithfield Foods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mona Lisa represented 500 neighbors against Chinese-owned Smithfield, alleging the antiquated “lagoon and spray” method of hog waste disposal was interfering with clients’ use and enjoyment of their&nbsp;homes&nbsp;and lands.&nbsp; In back-to-back&nbsp;trials&nbsp;extending through&nbsp;2018 and 2019,&nbsp;five different&nbsp;juries unanimously sided with the plaintiffs, awarding damages exceeding $500 million.&nbsp; The surprise twists and turns of the litigation, and the seemingly insurmountable odds, will be featured by author Corban Addison in his book,&nbsp;<u>Wastelands</u>, to be released to the public on June 7, 2022.</p><p>Mona Lisa&apos;s most recent legal efforts focus on two critical issues we currently face in our&nbsp;State&nbsp;as ordinary individuals: 1) excessive and unfair medical billing practices&nbsp;practiced&nbsp;by large hospital chains operating a monopoly in certain regions of the&nbsp;State,&nbsp;and 2) improving the safety and quality of care in North Carolina’s nursing homes, particularly those owned by private equity firms and&nbsp;for-profit&nbsp;chain corporations.</p><p>Regarding nursing home&nbsp;abuse, the firm has brought a putative class action claim regarding the alleged systematic understaffing of nursing homes, and represents one or more families in individual nursing home cases for abuse, injury or wrongful death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2022, in the State of the Union Address, President Biden and the White House highlighted nursing home negligence as an issue of national concern, identifying issues consistent with those identified by our clients.

Whitney’s passion for the law and justice was largely shaped by observing her mother advocate for clients in their deepest times of need during the entirety of her formative years.
