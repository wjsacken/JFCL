Most significantly, in 2021 he initiated and led the effort which secured nearly $5 million in funds from the 2021-22 state budget.&nbsp; Those funds will help build Partners’ new $12 million facility slated for completion in summer 2023.&nbsp; This new campus will greatly expand and improve childcare services in Rowan County for decades to come.</p><p>Mark lives in Salisbury with his wife Allison, two children Cate and Myers, and dog Drew.&nbsp; Whenever humanly possible, they all enjoy traveling, attending Tar Heels sporting events, or most any other outdoor activity with family or friends.</p>
