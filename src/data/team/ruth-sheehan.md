For more than 20 years, Ruth was a reporter and then metro columnist for The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh, providing a voice to the voiceless through her writing. In 2010, Ruth went back to law school at Carolina and now uses her advocacy skills on behalf of her clients and the Rhine Law Firm.</p><p>Ruth has tried hundreds of cases, both bench trials and to a jury. She has experience handling all sorts of negligence cases, from automobile and bicycle crashes to dog bites and premises liability cases. She has represented clients in state courts all the way to the NC Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, as well as in federal court. Ruth enjoys helping folks who have had their land condemned for public roads and other projects, and is relentless in advocating for clients in sexual harassment cases.</p>
