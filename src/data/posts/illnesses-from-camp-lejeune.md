---

For military members and their families who were stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1950 through the mid-1980s, potential health problems from water contamination are a serious concern. Cancers and other health issues plagued these members and families, many of whom have died or experienced ongoing, significant medical issues. The contamination was not discovered for a number of years, and by the time it was found there were already illnesses being reported in the military community.

The water was found to have benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), vinyl chloride, and other contaminants in it. Many of these chemicals come from dry cleaning, and they were found in nearly all the water at the camp's primary areas. That includes the water that was used in on-base housing, exposing spouses, children, and other family members to those dangerous chemicals on a daily basis.

###### What Camp Lejeune Illnesses Are Common?

While there are many illnesses that can potentially be tied back to the water at the camp, the most common Camp Lejeune illnesses are related to cancer. These include cancer of the esophagus, kidneys, breast, lungs, and bladder. Additionally, there are other types of cancer and other kinds of health problems related to the contaminated water. These problems have been seen in the past, and are still being found today in individuals who were exposed to the chemicals. Among the most frequently noted illnesses are:

- Multiple myeloma
- Leukemia
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Myelodysplastic syndromes
- Female infertility and miscarriage
- Hepatic steatosis
- Renal toxicity
- Neurobehavioral effects
- Scleroderma

With this significant number of illnesses, and the impact they can have on military members and their families, there have been numerous investigations into the water at the camp and the levels of contamination that water contained. The impact of the illnesses on future generations has also been noted, as a number of the family members who were impacted by the water quality were children, some of whom have died from cancer and other health conditions potentially related to chemical exposure.

###### The Impact of Illnesses on Future Generations

The VA has ruled that some above-mentioned illnesses are found to have a service-related connection, while there is insufficient evidence to make that ruling about other conditions. However, the impact of illnesses on future generations remains. Many families lost children and other loved ones to the health issues the water contamination at Camp Lejeune created. Still other children grew into adults with serious medical conditions and health issues that need monitoring and ongoing treatment.

Female infertility was one of the potential conditions caused by the contamination in the camp's water. While the VA failed to add it to their list of service-related illnesses, it has had an impact on the service members and spouses who wanted to add to their families. It has also impacted the female children born to these families, who may also struggle with infertility issues due to their exposure to contaminated water in their formative years. Generations of health problems and difficulties have come from this issue.
